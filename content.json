(发布和订阅) Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way. (持久化存储) Process streams of records as they occur. (顺序保证) Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications: (解决两大类问题) Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications — 实时数据流通道 Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data — 实时数据转换或者响应处理 kafka基本概念First a few concepts: Kafka is run as a cluster on one or more servers that can span multiple datacenters. — 可以跨数据中心 The Kafka cluster stores streams of records in categories called topics. — 聚类的数据流成为一个topic Each record consists of a key, a value, and a timestamp. — 每条记录都有key，value和timestamp Kafka has four core APIs: — 4 个核心api The Producer API allows an application to publish a stream of records to one or more Kafka topics. 生产者 The Consumer API allows an application to subscribe to one or more topics and process the stream of records produced to them. 消费者 The Streams API allows an application to act as a stream processor, consuming an input stream from one or more topics and producing an output stream to one or more output topics, effectively transforming the input streams to output streams. 流式api The Connector API allows building and running reusable producers or consumers that connect Kafka topics to existing applications or data systems. For example, a connector to a relational database might capture every change to a table. 连接者？ Kafka API图如下所示 Topics and LogsA topic is a category or feed name to which records are published. Topics in Kafka are always multi-subscriber; that is, a topic can have zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to the data written to it. 在广告业务中，比较典型的使用是，request是一个大的topic，还有广告相关曝光，点击日志等分别是不同的topic。 For each topic, the Kafka cluster maintains a partitioned log that looks like this: (一个topic会有多个partition，对于请求日志来说，因为太大了，所以一定有分片) Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended to—a structured commit log. The records in the partitions are each assigned a sequential id number called the offset that uniquely identifies each record within the partition. 每一个分片里都是顺序的，不可修改的，这样做也是为了性能，update是一个非常耗时的操作. The Kafka cluster durably persists all published records—whether or not they have been consumed—using a configurable retention period. For example, if the retention policy is set to two days, then for the two days after a record is published, it is available for consumption, after which it will be discarded to free up space. Kafka’s performance is effectively constant with respect to data size so storing data for a long time is not a problem. kafka可以根据设置的时间做持久化存储，性能和数据大小也是常数关系，对数据增长不敏感。 In fact, the only metadata retained on a per-consumer basis is the offset or position of that consumer in the log. This offset is controlled by the consumer: normally a consumer will advance its offset linearly as it reads records, but, in fact, since the position is controlled by the consumer it can consume records in any order it likes. For example a consumer can reset to an older offset to reprocess data from the past or skip ahead to the most recent record and start consuming from “now”. 跟comsumer相关的只有metadata，并且可以由consumer随意修改控制 This combination of features means that Kafka consumers are very cheap—they can come and go without much impact on the cluster or on other consumers. For example, you can use our command line tools to “tail” the contents of any topic without changing what is consumed by any existing consumers. 这种相结合的设计（kafka维护metadata，consumer负责控制），可以说兼顾了灵活和高效。另外的一种设计方式，是meta data由consumer来存储和控制–RabbitMQ？ The partitions in the log serve several purposes. First, they allow the log to scale beyond a size that will fit on a single server. Each individual partition must fit on the servers that host it, but a topic may have many partitions so it can handle an arbitrary amount of data. Second they act as the unit of parallelism—more on that in a bit. partiion分区是为了增加topic的容量和吞吐量 Distribution分布式The partitions of the log are distributed over the servers in the Kafka cluster with each server handling data and requests for a share of the partitions. Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of servers for fault tolerance. log的分片是分布式的，replicated数量也是根据配置来设置 Each partition has one server which acts as the “leader” and zero or more servers which act as “followers”. The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition while the followers passively replicate the leader. If the leader fails, one of the followers will automatically become the new leader. Each server acts as a leader for some of its partitions and a follower for others so load is well balanced within the cluster. 每个分片一定会有一个leader，0个或者多个followers。leader负责读写，followers是负责replicate。如果leader挂了，一个follower会自动成为新的leader。每个服务可以做几个分片的leader，也可以做其他几个分片的follower，来实现load balance。(这也是因为replicate决定了一个server会有多个partition，作为容灾) Geo-ReplicationKafka MirrorMaker provides geo-replication support for your clusters. With MirrorMaker, messages are replicated across multiple datacenters or cloud regions. You can use this in active/passive scenarios for backup and recovery; or in active/active scenarios to place data closer to your users, or support data locality requirements. Producers 生产者Producers publish data to the topics of their choice. The producer is responsible for choosing which record to assign to which partition within the topic. This can be done in a round-robin fashion simply to balance load or it can be done according to some semantic partition function (say based on some key in the record). More on the use of partitioning in a second! 生产者要保证均匀-平衡的写入同一个topic的分片中 Consumers 消费者Consumers label themselves with a consumer group name, and each record published to a topic is delivered to one consumer instance within each subscribing consumer group. Consumer instances can be in separate processes or on separate machines. 消费者有消费组的概念，在一个消费组内，一个记录只能被一个消费者消费。消费者实例可以是不同的进程，也可以在不同的机器上 If all the consumer instances have the same consumer group, then the records will effectively be load balanced over the consumer instances. 同一个组内的消费者会balanced的消费records If all the consumer instances have different consumer groups, then each record will be broadcast to all the consumer processes. 每个record会广播给不同消费者组 A two server Kafka cluster hosting four partitions (P0-P3) with two consumer groups. Consumer group A has two consumer instances and group B has four. 如上图所示，4个分片，两个消费组 More commonly, however, we have found that topics have a small number of consumer groups, one for each “logical subscriber”. Each group is composed of many consumer instances for scalability and fault tolerance. This is nothing more than publish-subscribe semantics where the subscriber is a cluster of consumers instead of a single process. 通常我们观察到，每个话题通常是有少数几个消费组，每个表示一个逻辑上的订阅。每个组由几个消费实例用于scalability和容错。这个语义也是包含发布-订阅 The way consumption is implemented in Kafka is by dividing up the partitions in the log over the consumer instances so that each instance is the exclusive consumer of a “fair share” of partitions at any point in time. This process of maintaining membership in the group is handled by the Kafka protocol dynamically. If new instances join the group they will take over some partitions from other members of the group; if an instance dies, its partitions will be distributed to the remaining instances. kafka的实现是基于log分配给消费实例，这样每个实例可以在任意时间点”公平”的消费。消费实例的平衡由kafka内部实现。如果新的加入，会从其他人身上分担一些，如果一个挂掉，会分给其他人。—看起来很像是一致性哈希保证的。 Kafka only provides a total order over records within a partition, not between different partitions in a topic. Per-partition ordering combined with the ability to partition data by key is sufficient for most applications. However, if you require a total order over records this can be achieved with a topic that has only one partition, though this will mean only one consumer process per consumer group. kafka只能保证同一个topic的同一个partition内有序。如果需要topic强有序，只能有一个分片，这样会导致只能有一个消费实例在一个消费组里。 Reference 参考 Apache Kafka 首页，了解最全面的 Apache Kafka 知识。 Apache kafka 工作原理介绍","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"StreamingSystem, MQ","slug":"StreamingSystem-MQ","permalink":"http://shiningstarpxx.github.com/tags/StreamingSystem-MQ/"}]},{"title":"linux使用zsh","slug":"linux使用zsh","date":"2019-04-04T11:29:53.000Z","updated":"2019-04-04T11:35:59.373Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/04/linux使用zsh/","link":"","permalink":"http://shiningstarpxx.github.com/2019/04/04/linux使用zsh/","excerpt":"","text":"背景shell目前主流是/bin/bash, 但是配色真丑。业界里提供了很多更好的bash，比如叫zsh。 在mac上和linux上我都安装了zsh 1.安装zsh包1yum -y install zsh 2.切换默认shell为zsh1chsh -s /bin/zsh 3.重启服务器让修改的配置生效这个没什么好多说的，我习惯在web端控制台直接重启。 4.安装on my zshcurlsh -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)&quot;wgetsh -c &quot;$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)&quot; 实际上到这一步oh my zsh就已经安装完成了。 5. 最后调整theme使用ys主题","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"linux, bash","slug":"linux-bash","permalink":"http://shiningstarpxx.github.com/tags/linux-bash/"}]},{"title":"Apache Kafka Installation on Mac using Homebrew","slug":"Apache-Kafka-Installation-on-Mac-using-Homebrew","date":"2019-04-03T14:08:08.000Z","updated":"2019-04-03T14:30:09.399Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/03/Apache-Kafka-Installation-on-Mac-using-Homebrew/","link":"","permalink":"http://shiningstarpxx.github.com/2019/04/03/Apache-Kafka-Installation-on-Mac-using-Homebrew/","excerpt":"","text":"背景学习大数据，离不开kafka，mac os上就得装一个。安装步骤如下 12$ brew cask install java$ brew install kafka 启动zookeeper1$ zookeeper-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties 启动kafka server1$ kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties 开始验证创建kafka topicA topic is a category or feed name to which records are published.
